# GentleReminder

This project is intended to be both a useful product and learning
practice for Android. It is a simple reminder app that allows you to
set what days of the week and what time to have a repeating notification/alarm.
You can choose to make the alarm silent, thus *gentle* reminder.

## Feautres

- Minimal Design UI
- Clutter Free
- Reminders can be repeated daily or weekly
- Quiet reminder setting, no annoying vibrating or ringing for
reminders that aren't vital

## Additional Info

GentleReminder doesn't give notifications after so many hours for
devices running Android Oreo. Android Lollipop to Nougat should work, but aren't tested.
